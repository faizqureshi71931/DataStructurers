# DataStructurers
I coded benchmarks the execution time of adding elements to different data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, TreeSet) for varying example sizes. It generates an array of elements and measures the time taken to add them to each data structure. The measured times are printed for different example sizes.
